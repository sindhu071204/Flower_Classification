This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying flower images into various categories. The project uses Python and libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. It includes a Jupyter Notebook, Flower_Classification.ipynb, where you can follow the step-by-step implementation, from loading the dataset to training the model and analyzing its performance. The notebook demonstrates key metrics such as accuracy and provides visualizations like confusion matrices to evaluate the model's effectiveness. To use this project, ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed along with necessary libraries, which can be installed using pip install -r requirements.txt. Contributions and suggestions to improve the project are welcome
